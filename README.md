# My first javascript

Today we are learning javascript.
At the end of the day you'll be able to call yourself a real programmer!

Following there will be a number of exercises each building on the previous.
Create a single repository for all exercises and **make sure to commit each time you finish an exercise**.

Duration: 1 day

# Exercises:

## 1. Hello World

1. Create an index.html page (no bootstrap required)
2. Include a javascript script
3. Use `alert` to make the page say "Hello World"

Hint: there is an example index file in this repo

## Commit

Don't forget to commit.

## 2. Code file

1. Move the previous code to it's own file, for example: `code.js`
2. Replace the code in `index.html` with this javascript file

Note: starting from here we'll always work in this code file.

## 3. Variables

1. Create a variable and give it the value `3`
2. `Alert` this value to the user

## 4. Math

1. Create a second variable, give it a value again
2. Add these two variables together
3. Alert the sum
4. Subtract these two numbers
5. Alert that value

## Commit

Did you commit after each exercise?

## 5. Interaction

1. Use a `prompt` to ask the user for his name
2. Show a dialog box (alert box) saying "Hello {name}!"

## 6. If

1. Ask the user if they are having a good day
2. If the answer is "yes" show a dialog box stating that you're happy for them
3. If they answer something else give them a compliment to feel better

## 7. Confirm

1. Ask the user several questions (for instance name, age, home town, ...)
2. Show their answers back to them, and ask to confirm they are correct
3. If not confirmed restart the process

## 8. Calculator using prompts

1. Use prompts to create a calculator capable of adding and subtracting
2. Ask for two numbers
3. Ask to choose between adding or subtracting
4. Show the result

## Commit & Notice

The next exercise is a hard one.
Make sure you have committed as you'll be changing a lot.

## 9. Calculator interface

Look out, this exercise introduces several new concepts all at once, don't panic, try each new one out on it's own before combining them for the exercise.

1. Add two `input` fields to your html document
2. Add two buttons: "add" and "subtract" in your html
2. Create a `function` that gets these numbers, and shows a dialog box with the sum
    * Hint: use `document.getElementById("element-id").value` to get the value from the input, don't forget to give each input a *unique* id
3. Create a second `function` that does subtraction
4. Use `onclick` with the buttons to call the correct functions
5. Extend your calculator so it can do multiplication too

## You're a programmer!

And you taught *yourself* to become one.

How cool is that!?
